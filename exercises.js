/* EXERCISE 1 - Looping a Triangle
create a triangle of # symbols 7 levels high in the console log
1. define string as # symbol
2. run 'for' loop as long as string length is less than or equal to 7
3. during each run add another "#" to the existing string and console log results
*/

/* EXERCISE 2 - FizzBuzz
write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100
two exceptions: 
1. for numbers divisible by 3, print 'Fizz'
2. for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print 'Buzz'

then modify the program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 */

    if (count % 3 == 0) {
      console.log("Fizz")
    }
    // print "Buzz" if remainder is 0 when divided by 5
    else if (count % 5 == 0) {
      console.log("Buzz")
